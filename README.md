Forthcoming in _Mind & Language_. 

This repository contains the data collected in our experiments and a script 
that documents and reproduces our analyses. 

## Manuscript
The manuscript is available 
[here](https://dillonplunkett.com/papers/debunking_manuscript.pdf) and the 
supplementary materials [here](https://dillonplunkett.com/papers/debunking_supplement.pdf).

## Data
The raw data for each experiment are in the [data](data) folder. Tidy data 
(with, e.g., more interpretable variable names) are available in the 
[tidy-data](data/tidy-data) subfolder. 

## Analyses
The analyses reported in the paper are performed in 
[debunking.Rmd](debunking.Rmd). Rendered versions (code and output together 
without needing to re-run the `R` code) are available as a 
[PDF](debunking.pdf), [HTML file](debunking.html), or 
[Markdown file viewable directly on GitHub](debunking.md).
