This HIT is a psychology experiment sponsored by the Concepts and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. In order to consent to participate, you MUST meet the following criteria:


* 18 years of age or older.

* Fluent speaker of English.

* Have not participated in this experiment before.



The experiment investigates how multiple pieces of information are integrated, and involves reading information and answering a few questions. The study takes about 6 minutes to complete, for which you will receive $0.40.

 
By selecting the “consent” button below, I acknowledge that I am 18 or older, that I am a fluent speaker of English, that I have not completed this experiment before,  that I have read this consent form, and that I agree to take part in the research.",Consider the following claims that refer to the story above and indicate how much you agree with each one. - This would be an important finding,Consider the following claims that refer to the story above and indicate how much you agree with each one. - This finding would be appropriate to teach in a high school science class,Consider the following claims that refer to the story above and indicate how much you agree with each one. - This finding would be appropriate to teach in a high school theology class,Consider the following claims that refer to the story above and indicate how much you agree with each one. - I would accept that this finding was probably true,Consider the following claims that refer to the story above and indicate how much you agree with each one. - I think it is appropriate for the government to fund research of this type,Consider the following claims that refer to the story above and indicate how much you agree with each one. - It would be important to know who funded this research,"Consider the following claims that refer to the story above and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Before accepting this finding, it would be important to see it replicated by an independent team of researchers","On a 1 to 7 scale where 1 represents “I am a confident atheist” and 7 represents “I am a confident believer”, to what extent do you believe that God exists? - To what extent do you believe that God exists?","What Would Motivate You to Participate in More Psychology Experiments?



Most modern theories in psychology recognize the fact that people do not think in a vacuum. Individual preferences and knowledge, along with situational variables, can greatly impact their behavior. In order to facilitate the research, we are interested in knowing certain factors about you, the decision maker. Specifically, we are interested in how closely you read the directions; if not, then some of our experiments that rely on changes in the instructions will be invalid. So, to demonstrate that you have read the instructions, please ignore the items below and write the word 'dax' in the box that says 'other'. Answering the material in this question provides more information, and having more data about participants is helpful for conducting the experiment. Thank you for entering the requested information.
