This HIT is a psychology experiment sponsored by the Concepts and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. In order to consent to participate, you MUST meet the following criteria:


* 18 years of age or older.

* Fluent speaker of English.

* Have not participated in this experiment before.



The experiment investigates how multiple pieces of information are integrated, and involves reading information and answering a few questions. The study takes about 7 minutes to complete, for which you will receive $0.40.

 
By selecting the “consent” button below, I acknowledge that I am 18 or older, that I am a fluent speaker of English, that I have not completed this experiment before,  that I have read this consent form, and that I agree to take part in the research.",Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Some diseases are caused by microorganisms called ‘germs’ that can infect a host organism.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Some infections are caused by exposure to particular types of fungus that can be transferred from person to person.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Humans evolved via natural selection and share common ancestry with many other species.,"Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Because human activity puts harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, the average temperature of the Earth is increasing.",Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - There is a God.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - There are such things as angels or spiritual beings.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Every person has a soulmate or life partner who has been preselected for him or her by God or some other spiritual force in the universe.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Every person has a special destiny defined for him or her by God or some other spiritual force in the universe.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Killing an innocent person is morally wrong.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Torturing an innocent person is morally wrong.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - Killing animals for human consumption is morally wrong.,Consider the following claims and indicate how much you agree with each one. - It is morally wrong to keep animals for their milk or eggs.,What effect do you think learning these pieces of information will have on Michael’s belief that [Field-Whether]?,"When you previously rated your agreement with various statements on a seven-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree), you rated your agreement with the claim above at  [Field-TargetRating].
 

Now we would like you to assume that you find out that there is activity your posterior striatum cortex when you consider whether [Field-Whether], and that your posterior striatum cortex appears to be working [Field-NormallyAbnormally]. Also, assume that all of the information above about the posterior striatum cortex is true. What effect would learning these pieces of information have on your belief about whether [Field-Whether]?","What effect do you think learning these facts should have on Michael’s belief that [Field-Whether]?



(For your reference, the material you already read is reproduced below.)







A new biotech company is studying a part of the brain called the posterior striatum cortex. The posterior striatum cortex is broadly associated with [Field-Domain] beliefs. When an individual expresses a [Field-Domain] belief, the posterior striatum cortex is active. However, there is no connection between the exact pattern of activity in the posterior striatum cortex and how confident an individual is in that belief. There is also no connection between activity in the posterior striatum cortex and whether the belief is actually true. 



Michael knows all of this information, and decides to volunteer for an experiment being performed by the biotech company. Michael has his brain scanned by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine. During the scan, the researcher asks him a series of questions, including one about whether [Field-Whether].



Michael believes the following claim, and tells the researcher this when he is asked.



CLAIM: [Field-Claim]



After the experiment, the researcher tells Michael that there was activity in his posterior striatum cortex when he expressed his belief that [Field-Whether]. The researcher also tells Michael that the specific pattern of brain activity observed in his brain suggests that his posterior striatum cortex is working [Field-NormallyAbnormally].","Again, assume that you learn what Michael learned about his brain activity about about your own brain activity. What effect should learning what he learned have on your belief about whether [Field-Whether]?

Most modern theories in psychology recognize the fact that people do not think in a vacuum. Individual preferences and knowledge, along with situational variables, can greatly impact their behavior. In order to facilitate the research, we are interested in knowing certain factors about you, the decision maker. Specifically, we are interested in how closely you read the directions; if not, then some of our experiments that rely on changes in the instructions will be invalid. So, to demonstrate that you have read the instructions, please ignore the items below and write the word 'dax' in the box that says 'other'. Answering the material in this question provides more information, and having more data about participants is helpful for conducting the experiment.
