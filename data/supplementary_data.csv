Most modern theories in psychology recognize the fact that people do not think in a vacuum. Individual preferences and knowledge, along with situational variables, can greatly impact their behavior. In order to facilitate the research, we are interested in knowing certain factors about you, the decision maker. Specifically, we are interested in how closely you read the directions; if not, then some of our experiments that rely on changes in the instructions will be invalid. So, to demonstrate that you have read the instructions, please ignore the items below and write the word 'dax' in the box that says 'other'. Answering the material in this question provides more information, and having more data about participants is helpful for conducting the experiment.
